# Kerbal source control - Free syncronisation/delayed-multiplayer mod for Kerbal space program
#### A new way of gameplay.

## Warning! This isn't real-time multiplayer!

## What is Kerbal source control?
Using Kerbal source control, you and your friends can edit the same KSP world at the same time!
Build Mun bases, colonize Laythe or build a space station!
The application is standalone and will manage your crafts so they appear on another users screen.
Even if you both work at the same time. Just save the game, run the program, and load the "LATEST VERSION ONLINE" save. All edits will be synced!

## How to use Kerbal source control?
Download the .exe file from this repository.
Then, move it to a location where it can write and edit files (It needs to save data locally)
When you did that, you can launch the program and KSP.
Inside the program, select a server using your arrow keys and enter.
Then, press enter to scan the for local crafts.
The individual changes will appear and you can choose whether or not you want to sync them.
After the sync is complete the program will stand by and wait until your press enter again.
**Make sure all users using the folder have the same/compatible mods installed!**

## How to create a server?
To create a server, you need to have some kind of cloud service/provider like NextCloud or OneDrive.
Create a new folder and share it with other users.
Inside that folder, create a new folder named "active_vessels".
Open Kerbal source control and in the server-selector choose "Add new".
Paste your folder path.
The program will then ask you to create a world named the same way your folder is (If you didn't already create it).
