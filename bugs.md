#Bug list
## The program crashes on startup
* Make sure the Program is inside an empty folder.
* Make sure the server path is correct. For that, open "servers.json" which should be in the same directory as the program. You can edit it directly.
* If the error persists, contact me via E-Mail sossinaydev@gmail.com
